# OPTIONAL: The default below is to use the Intel SDO Rendezvous server.
#           You may instead choose to use any other Revdezsou Server (e.g.,
#           the one inside any Open Horizon Management Hub). To do this,
#           change SDO_RV_URL below to your Rendezvous Server's URL (e.g.,
#           to use the one in your Open Horizon Management Hub, use:
#               export SDO_RV_URL=http://___________:8040
#           (filling in the blanks above with your Management Hub's service
#           IP address. Note that this address must be reachable by your
#           SDO devices in the field).
